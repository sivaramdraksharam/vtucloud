### Student Activity: Exploring Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

Welcome to this hands-on activity designed to help you understand and practice using Amazon S3. By the end of this activity, you will have a practical understanding of S3's key concepts, use cases, and operations. Let's dive in!

### Activity 1: Understanding Key Concepts in S3

#### Task 1: Buckets

- **Example 1**: Create a bucket named `student-projects-2023`. Ensure the name is unique across all AWS accounts.
- **Example 2**: Create another bucket named `backup-storage-2023` in a different region, such as `us-west-2`.
- **Example 3**: List all the buckets you have created in your AWS account using the AWS Management Console.

#### Task 2: Objects

- **Example 1**: Upload a text file named `notes.txt` to the `student-projects-2023` bucket.
- **Example 2**: Upload an image file named `profile.jpg` to the `backup-storage-2023` bucket.
- **Example 3**: Upload a video file named `presentation.mp4` to the `student-projects-2023` bucket.

#### Task 3: Keys

- **Example 1**: Identify the key for the `notes.txt` file in the `student-projects-2023` bucket.
- **Example 2**: Identify the key for the `profile.jpg` file in the `backup-storage-2023` bucket.
- **Example 3**: Identify the key for the `presentation.mp4` file in the `student-projects-2023` bucket.

### Activity 2: Exploring S3 Use Cases

#### Task 1: Backup and Restore

- **Example 1**: Use the `backup-storage-2023` bucket to store a backup of your local project files.
- **Example 2**: Restore a file from the `backup-storage-2023` bucket to your local machine.
- **Example 3**: Schedule regular backups of your important documents to the `backup-storage-2023` bucket.

#### Task 2: Data Archiving

- **Example 1**: Move old project files to the `Glacier` storage class for long-term archiving.
- **Example 2**: Archive a large dataset that you rarely access to the `Glacier Deep Archive` storage class.
- **Example 3**: Retrieve an archived file from the `Glacier` storage class and note the retrieval time.

#### Task 3: Content Distribution

- **Example 1**: Store website images in the `student-projects-2023` bucket for fast access.
- **Example 2**: Use S3 to host static content for a simple web application.
- **Example 3**: Distribute a video file stored in S3 to multiple users simultaneously.

### Activity 3: Managing S3 Storage Classes

#### Task 1: S3 Standard

- **Example 1**: Store frequently accessed documents in the `S3 Standard` storage class.
- **Example 2**: Analyze the cost of storing files in the `S3 Standard` class compared to other classes.
- **Example 3**: Monitor the access patterns of files stored in the `S3 Standard` class.

#### Task 2: S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- **Example 1**: Enable `Intelligent-Tiering` for a bucket to automatically manage data access tiers.
- **Example 2**: Track cost savings achieved by using `Intelligent-Tiering`.
- **Example 3**: Move a frequently accessed file to `Intelligent-Tiering` and observe any changes in access patterns.

#### Task 3: S3 Glacier

- **Example 1**: Archive a set of old project files to the `Glacier` storage class.
- **Example 2**: Calculate the cost difference between storing files in `Glacier` and `S3 Standard`.
- **Example 3**: Retrieve a file from `Glacier` and document the retrieval process.

### Activity 4: Hands-On Practice with S3 Operations

#### Task 1: Creating and Configuring Buckets

- **Example 1**: Create a bucket named `my-first-s3-bucket` in the `Mumbai` region.
- **Example 2**: Configure the bucket to allow public read access for a specific file.
- **Example 3**: Set up versioning for the `my-first-s3-bucket` to keep track of file changes.

#### Task 2: Uploading and Downloading Files

- **Example 1**: Upload a PDF document to the `my-first-s3-bucket` using the AWS CLI.
- **Example 2**: Download the uploaded PDF document to your local machine.
- **Example 3**: Use an AWS SDK to programmatically upload a file to the `my-first-s3-bucket`.

#### Task 3: Managing Permissions

- **Example 1**: Set permissions to allow only specific users to access a file in your bucket.
- **Example 2**: Create a bucket policy to restrict access based on IP address.
- **Example 3**: Use IAM roles to manage access to your S3 buckets for different users.
