### **Activity 1: Understanding Differences Between GKE, EKS, and AKS**

**Objective:** Familiarize yourself with the key differences between GKE, EKS, and AKS.

1. **Research Integration Features:**
   - GKE: Explore how GKE integrates with Google Cloud services like BigQuery and Cloud Storage.
   - EKS: Investigate how EKS works with AWS services such as S3 and RDS.
   - AKS: Look into AKS's integration with Azure services like Azure Blob Storage and Azure Monitor.

2. **Explore Management Features:**
   - GKE: Learn about GKE's automatic upgrades and scaling capabilities.
   - EKS: Understand the level of control you have over infrastructure in EKS.
   - AKS: Study AKS's automatic patching and scaling features.

3. **Compare Pricing Models:**
   - GKE: Calculate costs based on the number of worker nodes.
   - EKS: Determine costs for both control plane and worker nodes.
   - AKS: Assess pricing based on worker nodes and additional Azure services.

### **Activity 2: Key Architectural Differences and Pricing Models**

**Objective:** Understand the architectural differences and pricing models of GKE, EKS, and AKS.

1. **Control Plane Management:**
   - GKE: Identify how GKE manages the control plane automatically.
   - EKS: Explore the control you have over the EKS control plane.
   - AKS: Examine how AKS manages the control plane for you.

2. **Worker Node Costs:**
   - GKE: Calculate costs based on node specifications.
   - EKS: Analyze costs for both control plane and worker nodes.
   - AKS: Determine costs based on node specifications and Azure services.

3. **Infrastructure Management:**
   - GKE: Understand the infrastructure management responsibilities.
   - EKS: Explore the aspects of infrastructure you need to manage.
   - AKS: Learn about the infrastructure management handled by AKS.

### **Activity 3: Migrating a Web Application Across Cloud Providers**

**Objective:** Practice migrating a web application from one cloud provider to another using Kubernetes.

1. **Containerize Your Application:**
   - Use Docker to package a simple web application.
   - Ensure the container can run on any platform (GKE, EKS, AKS).

2. **Export Kubernetes Manifests:**
   - Create YAML files to define your application's deployment and service.
   - Ensure these manifests are portable across platforms.

3. **Deploy on a New Platform:**
   - Deploy your container and manifests on GKE.
   - Migrate and deploy the same application on EKS.
   - Finally, deploy the application on AKS.

### **Activity 4: Handling Cloud-Specific Services and Dependencies**

**Objective:** Learn how to manage cloud-specific services when migrating applications.

1. **Identify Cloud-Specific Services:**
   - GKE: List services like Google Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub.
   - EKS: Identify AWS services like S3 and SNS/SQS.
   - AKS: Recognize Azure services like Blob Storage and Service Bus.

2. **Use Open-Source Alternatives:**
   - Explore MinIO as an alternative to cloud-specific object storage.
   - Investigate RabbitMQ for messaging instead of cloud-specific services.

3. **Abstract the Service Layer:**
   - Create an abstraction layer in your application to switch between services.
   - Test the application with different cloud services based on the environment.

### **Activity 5: Best Practices for Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Deployment**

**Objective:** Implement best practices for deploying Kubernetes across multiple cloud providers.

1. **Centralized CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Set up a Jenkins pipeline to manage deployments on GKE, EKS, and AKS.
   - Use GitLab CI/CD to automate deployments across all platforms.

2. **Standardize Kubernetes Manifests:**
   - Ensure the same Kubernetes manifests are used across all platforms.
   - Validate consistency in deployment configurations.

3. **Monitor Across Platforms:**
   - Use Prometheus to monitor applications on GKE, EKS, and AKS.
   - Visualize metrics with Grafana for a centralized view.

### **Activity 6: Strategies for Disaster Recovery and Failover**

**Objective:** Develop strategies for disaster recovery and failover in a multi-cloud setup.

1. **Active-Active Setup:**
   - Deploy your application on multiple cloud providers simultaneously.
   - Test failover capabilities by simulating a provider outage.

2. **Backup and Restore:**
   - Regularly back up application data in a cloud-agnostic format.
   - Practice restoring data on a different cloud provider.

3. **Automated Failover:**
   - Use Kubernetes Federation to automate failover between providers.
   - Explore Crossplane for managing resources across clouds.
