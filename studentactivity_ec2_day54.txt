### **Activity 1: Understanding EC2 Basics**

1. **What is EC2?**
   - **Example 1**: Use EC2 to host a personal blog using WordPress.
   - **Example 2**: Deploy a Node.js application on an EC2 instance.
   - **Example 3**: Run a Python script for data analysis on an EC2 instance.

2. **Key Concepts and Benefits of EC2**
   - **Elasticity**: Scale your web application during peak traffic.
   - **Pay-as-you-go**: Run a development server for a few hours and only pay for that time.
   - **Global Reach**: Deploy an application in the US and Europe to serve users in both regions.

### **Activity 2: Exploring EC2 Instance Types**

1. **General Purpose Instances**
   - **Example 1**: Launch a t3.micro instance for a small web server.
   - **Example 2**: Use a t2.medium instance for a development environment.
   - **Example 3**: Deploy a small database on a t3.small instance.

2. **Compute-Optimized Instances**
   - **Example 1**: Run a machine learning model on a c5.large instance.
   - **Example 2**: Host a gaming server on a c5.xlarge instance.
   - **Example 3**: Perform scientific computations on a c5.2xlarge instance.

3. **Memory-Optimized Instances**
   - **Example 1**: Host a large database on an r5.large instance.
   - **Example 2**: Run an in-memory cache on an r5.xlarge instance.
   - **Example 3**: Deploy a high-performance computing application on an r5.2xlarge instance.

4. **Storage-Optimized Instances**
   - **Example 1**: Process big data on an i3.large instance.
   - **Example 2**: Run a data warehousing application on an i3.xlarge instance.
   - **Example 3**: Use an i3.2xlarge instance for high-speed data processing.

### **Activity 3: Exploring EC2 Pricing Models**

1. **On-Demand Instances**
   - **Example 1**: Launch a temporary test server for a few hours.
   - **Example 2**: Run a short-term project without long-term commitments.
   - **Example 3**: Deploy a demo application for a client presentation.

2. **Reserved Instances**
   - **Example 1**: Commit to a 1-year term for a production web server.
   - **Example 2**: Reserve an instance for a database server with predictable usage.
   - **Example 3**: Use reserved instances for a steady-state application.

3. **Spot Instances**
   - **Example 1**: Run batch processing jobs with flexible timing.
   - **Example 2**: Perform data analysis tasks that can be interrupted.
   - **Example 3**: Use spot instances for rendering tasks in animation projects.

### **Activity 4: Launching and Connecting to an EC2 Instance**

1. **Launching an EC2 Instance**
   - **Example 1**: Choose an Amazon Linux 2 AMI and launch a t3.micro instance.
   - **Example 2**: Select a Windows Server AMI and launch a t2.medium instance.
   - **Example 3**: Use a custom AMI to launch a c5.large instance.

2. **Configuring Security Groups and Key Pairs**
   - **Example 1**: Create a security group allowing SSH access on port 22.
   - **Example 2**: Set up a security group for HTTP access on port 80.
   - **Example 3**: Generate a new key pair for secure SSH access.

3. **Connecting to an EC2 Instance**
   - **Example 1**: Connect to a Linux instance using SSH with a .pem key file.
   - **Example 2**: Access a Windows instance using RDP with a downloaded RDP file.
   - **Example 3**: Use a terminal to SSH into an instance and install software.

### **Activity 5: Managing EC2 Instance Storage**

1. **EBS vs Instance Store**
   - **Example 1**: Attach an EBS volume to an instance for persistent storage.
   - **Example 2**: Use instance store for temporary data processing.
   - **Example 3**: Detach and reattach an EBS volume to another instance.

2. **Adding and Resizing EBS Volumes**
   - **Example 1**: Add a new EBS volume to an existing instance.
   - **Example 2**: Resize an EBS volume to accommodate more data.
   - **Example 3**: Create a snapshot of an EBS volume for backup.

3. **Backing Up Data with EBS Snapshots**
   - **Example 1**: Create a snapshot of a critical database volume.
   - **Example 2**: Use a snapshot to restore data to a new volume.
   - **Example 3**: Copy a snapshot to another region for disaster recovery.
