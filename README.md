## Microsoft Azure

### What is Microsoft Azure?

- **Definition**: Azure is a cloud computing platform by Microsoft that provides a range of services including computing, analytics, storage, and networking.
- **Purpose**: Allows businesses to rent computing resources over the internet instead of maintaining physical hardware.

### Why Use Azure?

1. **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down.
   - Example: An e-commerce site can handle increased traffic during sales.
   - Example: A startup can scale its infrastructure as it grows.
   - Example: A seasonal business can adjust resources based on demand.

2. **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use.
   - Example: Avoid upfront costs for hardware.
   - Example: Reduce costs by shutting down unused resources.
   - Example: Use reserved instances for predictable workloads.

3. **Global Reach**: Deploy applications closer to users.
   - Example: A global app can reduce latency by using regional data centers.
   - Example: A multinational company can comply with data residency requirements.
   - Example: A media company can deliver content faster to international audiences.

4. **Security**: Built-in tools for data and application security.
   - Example: Use Azure Security Center for threat protection.
   - Example: Implement multi-factor authentication with Azure Active Directory.
   - Example: Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

## Kubernetes

### What is Kubernetes?

- **Definition**: An open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Functionality**: Manages containers, ensuring consistent application performance across environments.

### Why Use AKS for Kubernetes Orchestration?

1. **Managed Service**: Reduces operational overhead.
   - Example: Azure manages the Kubernetes control plane.
   - Example: Automatic updates and patching of the Kubernetes environment.
   - Example: Simplified cluster management through Azure Portal.

2. **Integration with Azure Services**: Seamless integration with other Azure tools.
   - Example: Use Azure Monitor for cluster insights.
   - Example: Integrate with Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.
   - Example: Secure access with Azure Active Directory.

3. **Cost-Effective**: Only pay for the resources used.
   - Example: AKS service is free; pay for VMs and storage.
   - Example: Optimize costs with auto-scaling.
   - Example: Use spot instances for non-critical workloads.

## Setting Up an Azure Subscription and AKS Prerequisites

### Steps to Set Up an Azure Subscription:

1. **Sign Up for Azure**: Create a free account on the Azure website.
   - Example: Receive free credits to explore Azure services.
   - Example: Access to a wide range of Azure products.
   - Example: Start with a pay-as-you-go model.

2. **Install Azure CLI**: Tool for interacting with Azure from the terminal.
   - Example: Use CLI commands to manage resources.
   - Example: Automate tasks with scripts.
   - Example: Access Azure services programmatically.

3. **Set Up Resource Groups**: Organize related resources.
   - Example: Group resources by project or department.
   - Example: Simplify resource management and billing.
   - Example: Apply policies and permissions at the group level.

## Creating and Configuring an AKS Cluster

### Steps to Create an AKS Cluster:

1. **Using Azure Portal**:
   - Example: Create a cluster with a few clicks.
   - Example: Customize node size and count.
   - Example: Enable monitoring and logging during setup.

2. **Using Azure CLI**:
   - Example: Create a resource group with `az group create`.
   - Example: Deploy a cluster with `az aks create`.
   - Example: Generate SSH keys for secure access.

## Managing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on Azure

### Key Concepts of RBAC:

1. **Roles**: Define permissions for users.
   - Example: "Owner" role for full access.
   - Example: "Contributor" role for resource management.
   - Example: "Reader" role for view-only access.

2. **Role Assignments**: Assign roles to users or groups.
   - Example: Assign "Reader" role to a team member for monitoring.
   - Example: Grant "Contributor" role to a developer for deployment.
   - Example: Use custom roles for specific permissions.

## Deploying Applications to AKS

### Steps to Deploy an Application:

1. **Create a Deployment YAML File**: Define application settings.
   - Example: Specify container image and replicas.
   - Example: Set environment variables for the application.
   - Example: Configure resource limits and requests.

2. **Apply the Deployment**: Deploy using `kubectl apply`.
   - Example: Deploy a web application with a single command.
   - Example: Update deployments with new configurations.
   - Example: Rollback to previous versions if needed.

3. **Expose the Application**: Make it accessible via a service.
   - Example: Use a LoadBalancer service for external access.
   - Example: Create a ClusterIP service for internal communication.
   - Example: Implement NodePort for direct node access.

## Implementing Ingress Controllers and Load Balancing

### Steps to Implement an Ingress Controller:

1. **Install the NGINX Ingress Controller**:
   - Example: Deploy using a single `kubectl apply` command.
   - Example: Manage traffic routing with ingress rules.
   - Example: Support for SSL termination and URL-based routing.

2. **Create an Ingress Resource**: Define routing rules.
   - Example: Route traffic to different services based on URL paths.
   - Example: Use host-based routing for multiple domains.
   - Example: Configure TLS for secure connections.

## Using Persistent Volumes in AKS

### Steps to Use Persistent Volumes:

1. **Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: Request storage.
   - Example: Define storage size and access mode.
   - Example: Use Azure Disks for block storage.
   - Example: Use Azure Files for shared file storage.

2. **Mount the PVC to a Pod**: Specify in the podâ€™s YAML file.
   - Example: Persist data for a database application.
   - Example: Share data between multiple pods.
   - Example: Backup and restore data using persistent volumes.

## Monitoring and Scaling AKS Workloads

### Steps to Monitor and Scale Workloads:

1. **Enable Monitoring**: Use Azure Monitor for insights.
   - Example: Track CPU and memory usage of pods.
   - Example: Set up alerts for resource thresholds.
   - Example: Visualize metrics with dashboards.

2. **Auto-Scaling**: Adjust pod count based on usage.
   - Example: Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for scaling pods.
   - Example: Implement Vertical Pod Autoscaler for resource adjustments.
   - Example: Scale based on custom metrics with Prometheus.
